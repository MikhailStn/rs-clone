Beata is a super cool petsitter, and what turned out to be an expert on Goldens :)) She took our scrapyard for a walk, at first he panicked, but she managed bravely and the dog came back happy.

Julia has a hand with animals. The dog came back run out, happy, relaxed, went without screeching (which doesn\'t happen to him), then for three more days on the walk he told me that at Julia\'s was better and I should call for good advice :).', reviewOwner: 'Michail - Owner', id:"63fd4227dfd888f280da011d"},
